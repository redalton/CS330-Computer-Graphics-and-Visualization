# CS330-Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization

How do I approach designing software?
I first understanding the requirements, and prioritize them based on time requirements and priority. I then prioritize learning about the technology, if its a technology that I haven't used before - such as OpenGL. I then analyze the requirements and break them down into code elements and design the overall code architecture. If I don't understand a concept I search for resources online to help me understand how others have solved the problem.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
As the project work progressed, I consistently evaluated whether I was on or off track with all requirements and within the time constraints. I found OpenGL very challenging to learn, so I was pressed for time during the more difficult weeks. This project helped me with my time management skills. Solving problems on this project was incredibly rewarding.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
My design process would work very well for future work, since the design principles I follow can be applied to any project. Understanding the customer requirements and applying those requirements into code are good practices for any development project.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Part of what made this project challenging was that development in OpenGL encompasses software development, 3D design, art composition, and lighting design. I started with my scene image, and analyzed what primitive shapes best fit the objects in the scene. Developing the code to create some of these primitives, such as the torus and the sphere, was not straightforward and involved heavy amounts of mathematics and trigonometry. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
Developing this project was an incredibly iterative process. I ensured that my scene compiled and stood on its own before adding any new functionality. Since this project involved many parts that were interdependent, one small issue could snowball into many issues and make it difficult to identify the root cause. That is why I made sure not to add too much new functionality at once, and test along the way.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
This project made me find new ways to manage my time to reach the given deadlines. There were many things in the scene that I would have fine-tuned or done differently if I was able to spend more time on the project. I prioritized getting the requirements into the scene before I focused on refinement and details.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Learning OpenGL gave me a greater understanding of how objects are rendered in a scene, and how representations of those objects make their way to a monitor. With this understanding, I can now see how higher-level computer graphics programs like CAD programs and 3D design products like Blender, go about creating projects and rendering them to a scene. I also gained a new appreciation for game developers that manage to use OpenGL to create their visualizations.
